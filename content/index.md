Postgres Guide
==============

We here are very big fans of Postgres as a database and believe it is often the best database for the job. For many though, working with and maintaining Postgres involves a steep learning curve. This guide is designed as an aid for beginners and experienced users to find specific tips and explore tools available within Postgres. 

If you want to take the quick & painless approach instead, there are great services available for Postgres hosting. In particular if you're need something more scalable for Postgres hosting take a look at [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com).

Some History
------------

Postgres has gotten much more attention in recent years. It has accelerated its pace, meanwhile other RDMS's have slowed in releases. [Postgre SQL/PostgreSQL/Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) has a very long history in databases, with its very name coming from one of the earliest databases Ingres (Post ingres = Postgres) and its own implementation beginning in [1986](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/history.html).
